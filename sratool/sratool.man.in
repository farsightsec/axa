.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Fl dhINV
.Op Fl c Ar cfile

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sratool
connects and sends Advanced Exchange Access (AXA) protocol messages
to SIE Remote Access (SRA) servers
and displays the responses.
It can also tunnel SIE data like
.Xr sratunnel 1 .
.Pp
.Nm sratool
is a programming example for the Advanced Exchange Access (AXA)
applications programming interface to \*(SR servers, the AXA protocol.
It also demonstrates the use of the AXA helper library,
.Pa libaxa.a .
.Pp
Start using
.Nm
with the
.Ic connect
command described below.
Use one or more
.Ic watch
commands to specify interesting patterns of SIE messages or IP packets.
Limit the number of packets or messages transmitted from the SRA server
or displayed with the
.Ic rate limit
and
.Ic count
commands.
Turn on one or more channels of messages or packets with the
.Ic channel
command.
.Pp
Unless more output is enabled with the
.Ic verbose
command,
most messages or packets are displayed in two lines.
The first line includes the channel number on which it was received,
the SIE message vendor of the message,
the name of the field that caused the message to be selected,
and the contents of the field.
The second line is a summary of the message or packet.
.Pp
When more verbose output is enabled or when
.Nm
does not understand the message,
IP packets are printed in ASCII
and SIE messages are printed in the standard
.Ic nmsg
presentation format also seen from
.Xr nmsgtool 1 .
.Ss OPTIONS
.so options.man
.Ss COMMANDS
.Nm
executes commands read from the standard input.
Command history is available if the standard input is a terminal.
Multiple commands can be specified at once by separating them with semicolons.
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.so cmds.man
.It Ic channel Bro Ar list | Bro Ar on|off Brc Bro Ar all|chN Brc Brc
List available SRA channels or enable or disable
one or all SIE channels.
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic delete Op Ar watches Op Ar all
With a tag (numeric label), stop or delete the specified watch.
Without a tag (or with the keyword "all"), delete all watches.
.It Ic get channels
List all SIE channels available to the user on the SRA server.
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic get watches
With a tag (numeric label), get (list) the specified watch.
Without a tag (or with the keyword "all"), list all watches.
.It Ar tag Ic watch Brq Ar ip=IP[/n] | dns=[*.]dom | ch=chN | errors
Tell the SRA server to send NMSG messages or IP packets that are to,
from, or contain the specified IP addresses,
that contain the specified domain name,
that arrived at the server on the specified SIE channel,
or are SIE messages or IP packets that could not be decoded.
.Ar Tag
is a number labeling the watch.
.so srawatch.man
.El
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic list watches
Synonym for the
.Em get watches
command.
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic stop Op Ar watch Op Ar all
Synonym for the
.Em delete
command.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following captures and displays one SIE
.Ic newdomain
message.
The "dns=*." watch or pattern was matched by the "nflxso.net"
domain in DNS NS rdata.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ sratool

.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width config
.It Ar ~/.axa/config
contains AXA client configuration data. Currently supported are connection
aliases that provide the user with a facility to create shortcut mnemonics to
specify the SRA server connection string. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cat ~/.axa/config
# SRA
alias:sra-apikey=apikey:<elided>@axa-sie.domaintools.com,49500

.Ed

If the user wanted to connect to SRA, she would only have to remember
"sra-apikey" and could do:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ sratool
sra> connect sra-apikey
.Ed
.Pp
This config file is shared for
.Nm ,
radtool, sratunnel, and radtunnel. Because this file can contain sensitive
information such as apikeys, it must not be readable or writeable to anybody
other than "owner" or
.Nm sratool
will not load.
.It Ar ~/.sratool_history
contains the command history from previous
.Nm sratool
and/or
.Nm radtool
invocations
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If set, AXACONF specifies the AXA configuration directory instead of the
default,
.Pa ~/.axa
or
.Pa @CONFDIR@ .
