.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Radtool
connects and sends Advanced Exchange Access (AXA) protocol messages
to Realtime Anomaly Detector (RAD) servers
and displays the responses.
It can also tunnel SIE data like
.Xr radtunnel 1 .
.Pp
.Nm Radtool
is a programming example for the Advanced Exchange Access (AXA)
applications programming interface to \*(SR servers, the AXA protocol.
It also demonstrates the use of the AXA helper library,
.Pa libaxa.a .
.Pp
Start using
.Nm
with the
.Ic connect
command described below.
Use one or more
.Ic anomaly
commands to specify interesting patterns of SIE messages or IP packets.
Limit the number of packets or messages transmitted from the SRA server
or displayed with the
.Ic rate limit
and
.Ic count
commands.
.Pp
Unless more output is enabled with the
.Ic verbose
command,
most messages or packets are displayed in two lines.
The first line includes the channel number on which it was received,
the SIE message vendor of the message,
the name of the field that caused the message to be selected,
and the contents of the field.
The second line is a summary of the message or packet.
.Pp
When more verbose output is enabled or when
.Nm
does not understand the message,
IP packets are printed in ASCII
and SIE messages are printed in the standard
.Ic nmsg
presentation format also seen from
.Xr nmsgtool 1 .
.Ss OPTIONS
.so options.man
.Ss COMMANDS
.Nm
executes commands read from the standard input.
Command history is available if the standard input is a terminal.
Multiple commands can be specified at once by separating them with semicolons.
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.so cmds.man
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic delete Op Ar anomaly Op Ar all
With a tag (numeric label), stop or delete the specified anomaly.
Without a tag (or with the keyword "all"), delete all anomalies.
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic stop Op Ar anomaly Op Ar all
Synonmym for the
.Em delete
command.
.It Ar tag Ic watch Brq Ar ip=IP[/N][(shared) | dns=[*.]dom[(shared)]
Specify IP addresses or domain names relevant to the
anomaly detection modules specified by subsequent
.Ic anomaly
commands with the same tag.
.so radwatch.man
.El
.It Ar tag Ic anomaly Ar name Op Ar parameters
Start the named anomaly detector module.
The relevant domains and IP addresses are specified by preceding
.Ic watch
commands with the same tag.
The parameters for each module are described it its man page.
.Ic Tag
is a number that labels the module and the relevant watches as well as
other modules using the same watches.
.It Oo Ar tag Oc Ic list anomaly
If a tag is present,
list the set of watches and anomaly detection modules with that tag.
Without a tag,
list all active as well as available anomaly detection modules
.It Ic runits
Ask the server to report user's current RAD balance.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width fields
.It Pa fields
defines relationships among and meanings of SIE message fields.
Its contents should rarely if ever need to be changed.
.It Pa certs
is the directory set with
.Fl S
that contains TLS certificate and key files.
.It Pa config
is the
.Xr ssh_config 5
configuration file used with
.Ar connect\ ssh:...
connections.
The usual
.Xr ssh 1
sequence is used, starting with
.Pa ~/.ssh/config .
"Host" stanzas in the file can simplify connections to \*(SR servers.
.It Pa ~/.sratool_history
contains the command history from previous
.Nm radtool
and/or
.Nm sratool
invocations
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If set, AXACONF specifies the AXA configuration directory instead of,
.Pa ~/.axa
or
.Pa @CONFDIR@ .
