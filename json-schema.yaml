title: axamd stream output schema
description: Schema describing the output of the AXAMD stream command in axa+json mode.  This schema is very large and its use should probably be restricted to development and not be used to validate input at wire speeds.

                description: "A tag is a 16-bit identifier used to uniquely \"tag\" specific events during the lifetime of an AXA session. To refer to these events, the client or server will use the tag. Some AXA messages do not require tags, in that case the tag field should be 0. Required tags must be unique during the lifetime of the corresponding client request. Some client requests such as a \"watch\" can last indefinitely and will elicit many server responses all with the same tag."

                description:  RAD and SRA servers start the client-server conversation with a AXA_P_OP_HELLO announcing the protocol versions that the server understands, a version string, and an ID unique among connections to a single server.  Clients can include those IDs in AXA_P_OP_JOIN messages to flag connections that are part of a bundle.  Because AXA_P_OP_HELLO is sent before the client has said anything and so declared its protocol version, AXA_P_OP_HELLO must remain the same in all versions of the AXA protocol.
