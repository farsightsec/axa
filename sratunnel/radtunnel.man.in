.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm radtunnel
transfers selected Security Information Exchange (SIE) data
from Real-time Anomaly Detector (RAD) servers to the local network.
The connection to the server is created and restored after problems
with binary exponential delays between retries.
.Pp
.Nm radtunnel
is a tool for tunneling SIE data using the Advanced Exchange Access (AXA)
protocol. It also demonstrates the use of the AXA helper library,
.Pa libaxa.a .
.Ss OPTIONS
The following arguments are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl A Ar interval
specifies the accounting interval. Every
.Ar interval
seconds an accounting request will be made to server and the results will be
emitted to stdout. When specifying this mode, you also need to specify
.Fl d
at the command line.
.It Fl a Ar anomaly Op parameters
specifies RAD anomaly detection module and its parameters.
There must be at least one
.Fl a
in RAD mode.
.It Fl C Ar count
stop
.Nm
or (with
.Fl k
specified)
close the current output and reopen a new output after
.Ar count
payloads have been processed.
.It Fl d
enable debugging reports or increase them after the first
.Fl d .
.It Fl E Ar ciphers
specifies a list ciphers for apikey connections.
.It Fl h
display options summary.
.It Fl I Ar size
sets the maximum index size (in multiples of the system pagesize) for the timestamp
index. The default for this setting is 2560, which given a 4096 pagesize,
results in the maximum index being 10MB.
There is no specific correlation between the amount of data generated
and the size of the index needed. The recommendation is to set the
maximum size to "as large as possible". The disk space will not automatically
be allocated, this parameter will only constrain the maximum amount that can be used.
.It Fl i Ar interval
enables timestamp indexing every
.Ar interval
nmsgs. This mode writes to a pre-existing (or creates an) lmdb-backed key-value
store of nmsg timestamp/file offset pairs. The keys are the epoch portion of the
nmsg timestamp for which the offsets refer back to. It is intended to be used
as a hints file to speed subsequent cherry-picking of nmsgs from the nmsg data
file it backs. It is most useful when the corresponding nmsg data file is
anticipated to grow large.

This mode may only be used with nmsg file-based outputs and, because
.Nm
needs to know when filesystem writes have occurred, it must be run in
unbuffered mode (
.Fl u
). If you specify the append option (
.Fl p
), it is assumed you are continuing a previous session so you must also specify
a previously created nmsg file which must also have a corresponding previously
created timestamp index mdb file.

.Nm
will always write an index for the first nmsg and every
.Ar interval
nmsgs thereafter. Note that because currently only the epoch portion of
the timestamp is significant,
.Nm
will only write entries at most, once per second. So for modules where
anomaly hits can show up many times per second, a low
.Ar interval
value may not be honored and indexes would instead only be written once per
second. To achieve this desired balance between index coverage and channel
velocity, some experimentation with different
.Ar interval
values may be required.

If
.Nm
finds a previously created tsindex file and is not in append mode, it will
clobber the file.

Note that in an effort to keep the file-system clean,
.Nm
will remove the lmdb-generated lock files after execution (or when using
.Fl k ,
after rotation).

.It Fl k Ar cmd
enables
.Cm kicker
mode and makes
.Fl C
,
.Fl T
or
.Fl Z
continuous. In this mode output file names are suffixed with a timestamp and
.Nm
runs continuously, rotating output files as payload counts or the output file size
exceeds a threshold or time intervals expire.
.Ar cmd
specifies the command to run on output files after rotation. If
.Ar cmd
is set to the empty string
.Cm '' ,
then no command is executed and only file rotation is performed.

This option must be combined with either
.Fl C
,
.Fl T
or
.Fl Z
but may not be used with
.Fl i .
Only nmsg file-based outputs are supported.

.It Fl m Ar sampling-rate
specifies the sampling rate. Sets the percentage (between 0.1 and 100.0) that
the RAD server will send.
.It Fl n Ar config-file
specify location for AXA client configuration file.
.It Fl O
enable a spinning bar output indicator on stdout.
.It Fl p
append output to specified file (only valid for nmsg file-based outputs).
.It Fl o Ar out-addr
specifies the destination of the SIE data.
It can be forwarded as nmsg messages to a UDP or TCP port
or as raw IP packets to a file, FIFO, or network interface.
.ds CT
.so fwd.man
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
will result in the current PID  being written to
.Ar pidfile .
The file will be deleted upon program exit.
.It Fl r Ar rate-limit
tells the server to send at most
.Ar rate-limit
SIE messages and raw IP packets per second.
.It Fl s Ar server
specifies the server that is the source of the SIE data.
The server can be specified with any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width unix
.It Sm off Ar alias Sm on
Connect to a server using an alias shortcut mnemonic (see FILES section for
more information).
.It Sm off Ar apikey: Ar <users_apikey>@ Ar host,port Sm on
Identify and authenticate the user via a Farsight Security provided apikey. The connection will be encrypted using the TLS protocol.
.It Sm off Ar tcp: Ar user@ Ar host,port Sm on
The connection will be made with the host name or IP address and port number
using clear text over TCP/IP.
.It Sm off Ar unix: Ar user@ Ar /ud/socket Sm on
This connection uses a UNIX domain socket connected to a local server.
.El
.It Fl T Ar secs
stop
.Nm
or (with
.Fl k
specified)
close the current output and reopen a new output on a time interval modulo the
.Ar secs
parameter. For example,
.Ar -t 3600
means an hour after started or reopened.
.It Fl t
enable tracing reports on the server or increase them after the first
.Fl t .
.It Fl V
displays the version of
.Nm
and its preferred version of the AXA protocol.
.It Fl w Ar watch
There must be at least one
.Fl w
with a RAD watch to specify the interesting SIE messages or
dark channel IP packets.
.so radwatch.man
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Ar (shared)
can be appended to
.Ar IP
and
.Ar
dns
watches to indicate addresses or domains that are not used exclusively.
.It Fl z
enable nmsg zlib container compression.
.It Fl Z Ar size
stop
.Nm
or (with
.Fl k
specified)
close the current output and reopen a new output after the output file meets
or exceeds
.Ar size .
This mode may only be used with file-based outputs. Additionally,
because nmsg-based file outputs are by default buffered, it is
recommended when writing to one that this option be used in
unbuffered mode (
.Fl u
).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following connects to a RAD server at example.com, loads the Brand
module looking for the brand "farsight", and sends all anomaly hit nmsgs to
the local UDP port 8000 on 127.0.0.1:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
radtunnel -s apikey:<yourapikey>@example.com,1012 -o nmsg:127.1,8000 \\
	-w dns=*. -a brand brand=farsight
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width config
.It Ar ~/.axa/config
contains AXA client configuration data. Currently supported are connection
aliases that provide the user with a facility to create shortcut mnemonics to
specify the RAD server connection string. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cat ~/.axa/config
# RAD
alias:rad-apikey=apikey:<yourapikey>@example.com,1012

.Ed
If the user wanted to connect to RAD, she would only have to remember
"rad-apikey" and could do:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ radtunnel -s rad-apikey ...
.Ed
.Pp
This config file is shared for
.Nm ,
sratunnel, radtool, and sratool. Because this file can contain sensitive
information such as apikeys, it must not be readable or writeable to anybody
other than "owner" or
.Nm radtunnel
will not load.
.It Ar foo.mdb
is an lmdb key-value store containing nmsg timestamp/file offset pairs (a
"tsindex" file). See the
.Fl i
option for details.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If set, AXACONF specifies the AXA configuration directory instead of the
default,
.Pa ~/.axa
or
.Pa @CONFDIR@ .
.Sh SIGNALS
On operating systems that support \fBSIGINFO\fP (including BSDish systems like
FreeBSD and macOS), the user can type
"ctrl-t" at the command line during a running
.Nm
process and get information about the session. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 176 messages, 176 hits

.Ed
Note that by default, an additional line of information is printed by
the kernel (system load and process information):
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
\fB^T\fPload: 1.39  cmd: radtunnel 7060 running 0.06u 0.00s
rad connected, sent 4 messages, received 304 messages, 304 hits

.Ed
This can be disabled via: \fIstty nokerninfo\fP. Example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ radtunnel -A 10 -d -s rad-apikey...
connecting to rad-apikey...
\fB^T\fPload: 1.39  cmd: radtunnel 7060 running 0.06u 0.00s
rad connected, sent 4 messages, received 304 messages, 304 hits
^C
$ stty nokerninfo
$ radtunnel -A 10 -d -s rad-apikey...
connecting to rad-apikey...
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 176 messages, 176 hits
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 416 messages, 416 hits
