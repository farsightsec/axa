.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Radtunnel
transfers selected Security Information Exchange (SIE) data
from Real-time Anomaly Detector (RAD) servers to the local network.
The connection to the server is created and restored after problems
with binary exponential delays between retries.
.Pp
.Nm Radtunnel
is a tool for tunneling SIE data using the Advanced Exchange Access (AXA)
protocol. It also demonstrates the use of the AXA helper library,
.Pa libaxa.a .
.Ss OPTIONS
The following arguments are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl A Ar interval
specifies the accounting interval. Every
.Ar interval
seconds an accounting request will be made to server and the results will be
emitted to stdout. When specifying this mode, you also need to specify
.Fl d
at the command line.
.It Fl a Ar anomaly Op parameters
specifies RAD anomaly detection module and its parameters.
There must be at least one
.Fl a
in RAD mode.
.It Fl C Ar count
stops
.Nm
after
.Ar count
SIE messages and raw IP packets.
.It Fl d
enable debugging reports or increase them after the first
.Fl d .
.It Fl E Ar ciphers
specifies a list ciphers for TLS connections.
.It Fl h
display options summary.
.It Fl m Ar sampling-rate
specifies the sampling rate. Sets the percentage (between 0.1 and 100.0) that
the RAD server will send.
.It Fl n Ar config-file
specify location for AXA client configuration file.
.It Fl O
enable a spinning bar output indicator on stdout.
.It Fl p
append output to specified file (only valid for nmsg file-based outputs).
.It Fl o Ar out-addr
specifies the destination of the SIE data.
It can be forwarded as NMSG messages to a UDP or TCP port
or as raw IP packets to a file, FIFO, or network interface.
.ds CT
.so fwd.man
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
will result in the current PID  being written to
.Ar pidfile .
The file will be deleted upon program exit.
.It Fl r Ar rate-limit
tells the server to send at most
.Ar rate-limit
SIE messages and raw IP packets per second.
.It Fl S Ar certs
overrides the default directory containing SSL certificates and keys.
Its default is
.Pa @CONFDIR@/certs .
.It Fl s Ar server
specifies the server that is the source of the SIE data.
The server can be specified with any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width unix
.It Sm off Ar alias Sm on
Connect to a server using an alias shortcut mnemonic (see FILES section for
more information).
.It Sm off Ar apikey: Ar <users_apikey>@ Ar host,port Sm on
Identify and authenticate the user via a Farsight Security provided apikey.
The connection will be encrypted using the same TLS semantics as the tls
transport below.
.It Sm off Ar ssh: Oo Ar user@ Oc Ar host Sm on
The server will be contacted using the ssh protocol.
These connections usually use default ssh
.Xr ssh_config 1
files to specify the required public keys
and optionally the fully qualified host name and user names associated
with the public key.
Use
.Fl dddd
to diagnose ssh connection problems.
.It Sm off Ar tcp: Ar user@ Ar host,port Sm on
The connection will be made with the host name or IP address and port number
using clear text over TCP/IP.
.It Sm off Ar unix: Ar user@ Ar /ud/socket Sm on
This connection uses a UNIX domain socket connected to a local server.
.It Ar tls:cert,key@host,port
Use the TLS protocol with the certificate in the
.Ar cert
file and the private key in the
.Ar key
file.
If not absolute, the files are in the
.Fl S Ar certs
directory.
.El
.It Fl t
enable tracing reports on the server or increase them after the first
.Fl t .
.It Fl V
displays the version of
.Nm
and its preferred version of the AXA protocol.
.It Fl w Ar watch
There must be at least one
.Fl w
with a RAD watch to specify the interesting SIE messages or
dark channel IP packets.
.so radwatch.man
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Ar (shared)
can be appended to
.Ar IP
and
.Ar
dns
watches to indicate addresses or domains that are not used exclusively.
.It Fl z
enable NMSG zlib container compression.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following connects to a RAD server at example.com, loads the Brand Sentry
module looking for the brand "farsight", and sends all anomaly hit NMSGs to
the local UDP port 8000 on 127.0.0.1:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
radtunnel -s apikey:<yourapikey>@example.com,1012 -o nmsg:127.1,8000 \\
	-w dns=*. -a brand_sentry brand=farsight
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width config
.It Ar certs
is the directory set with
.Fl S
that contains TLS certificate and key files.
.It Ar ~/.axa/config
contains AXA client configuration data. Currently supported are connection
aliases that provide the user with a facility to create shortcut mnemonics to
specify the RAD server connection string. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cat ~/.axa/config
# RAD
alias:rad-apikey=apikey:<yourapikey>@example.com,1012

.Ed
If the user wanted to connect to RAD, she would only have to remember
"rad-apikey" and could do:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ radtunnel -s rad-apikey ...
.Ed
.Pp
This config file is shared for
.Nm ,
sratunnel, radtool, and sratool. Because this file can contain sensitive
information such as apikeys, it must not be readable or writeable to anybody
other than "owner" or
.Nm radtunnel
will not load.
.It Ar config
is the
.Xr ssh_config 5
configuration file used with
.Ar connect\ ssh:...
connections.
"Host" stanzas in the file can simplify connections to AXA servers.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If set, AXACONF specifies the AXA configuration directory instead of the
default,
.Pa ~/.axa
or
.Pa @CONFDIR@ .
.Sh SIGNALS
On operating systems that support \fBSIGINFO\fP (including BSDish systems like
FreeBSD and macOS), the user can type
"ctrl-t" at the command line during a running
.Nm
process and get information about the session. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 176 messages, 176 hits

.Ed
Note that by default, an additional line of information is printed by
the kernel (system load and process information):
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
\fB^T\fPload: 1.39  cmd: radtunnel 7060 running 0.06u 0.00s
rad connected, sent 4 messages, received 304 messages, 304 hits

.Ed
This can be disabled via: \fIstty nokerninfo\fP. Example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ radtunnel -A 10 -d -s rad-apikey...
connecting to rad-apikey...
\fB^T\fPload: 1.39  cmd: radtunnel 7060 running 0.06u 0.00s
rad connected, sent 4 messages, received 304 messages, 304 hits
^C
$ stty nokerninfo
$ radtunnel -A 10 -d -s rad-apikey...
connecting to rad-apikey...
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 176 messages, 176 hits
\fB^T\fPrad connected, sent 4 messages, received 416 messages, 416 hits
