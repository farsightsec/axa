.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Radtunnel
transfers selected Security Information Exchange (SIE) data
from Realtime Anomaly Detector (RAD) servers to the local network.
The connection to the server is created and restored after problems
with binary exponential delays between retries.
.Pp
.Nm Radtunnel
is a programming example for using the Advanced Exchange Access (AXA)
applications programming interface, the AXA protocol.
It also demonstrates the use of the AXA helper library,
.Pa libaxa.a .
.Ss OPTIONS
The following arguments are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl V
displays the version of
.Nm
and its preferred version of the AXA protocol.
.It Fl d
enable debugging reports or increase them after the first
.Fl d .
.It Fl t
enable tracing reports on the server or increase them after the first
.Fl t .
.It Fl O
enable a spinning bar output indicator on stdout.
.It Fl R
switches from RAD to SRA mode.
In SRA mode,
.Fl a
is not allowed
and
.Fl c
is required.
In RAD mode,
.Fl a
is required
and
.Fl c
is not allowed.
.It Fl z
enable nmsg zlib container compression.
.It Fl C Ar count
stops
.Nm
after
.Ar count
SIE messages and raw IP packets.
.It Fl r Ar rate-limit
tells the server to send at most
.Ar rate-limit
SIE messages and raw IP packets per second.
.It Fl E Ar ciphers
specifies a list ciphers for TLS connections.
.It Fl S Ar certs
overrides the default directory containing SSL certificates and keys.
Its default is
.Pa @CONFDIR@/certs .
.It Fl s Ar server
specifies the server that is the source of the SIE data.
The server can be specified with any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width unix
.It Sm off Ar ssh: Oo Ar user@ Oc Ar host Sm on
The server will be contacted using the ssh protocol.
These connections usually use default ssh
.Xr ssh_config 1
files to specify the required public keys
and optionally the fully qualified host name and user names associated
with the public key.
Use
.Fl dddd
to diagnose ssh connection problems.
.It Sm off Ar tcp: Ar user@ Ar host,port Sm on
The connection will be made with the host name or IP address and port number
using clear text over TCP/IP.
.It Sm off Ar unix: Ar user@ Ar /ud/socket Sm on
This connection uses a UNIX domain socket connected to a local server.
.It Ar tls:cert,key@host,port
Use the TLS protocol with the certificate in the
.Ar cert
file and the private key in the
.Ar key
file.
If not absolute, the files are in the
.Fl S Ar certs
directory.
.El
.It Fl w Ar watch
There must be at least one
.Fl w
with a RAD watch to specify the interesting SIE messages or
dark channel IP packets.
.so radwatch.man
.El
.Pp
With
.Fl R
and so in RAD mode, channel and error watches are not permitted.
In addition,
.Ar (shared)
can be appended to
.Ar IP
and
.Ar
dns
watches to indicate addresses or domains that are not used exclusively.
.It Fl a Ar anomaly Op parameters
specifies an RAD anomaly detection module and its parameters with
.Fl R
and so in RAD mode.
There must be at least one
.Fl a
in RAD mode.
.It Fl o Ar out-addr
specifies
the destination of the SIE data.
It can be forwarded as
.Em nmsg
messages to a UDP or TCP port
or as raw IP packets to a file, FIFO, or network interface.
.ds CT
.so fwd.man
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following sends all IP traffic matching the watches using the
ip_probe anomaly module as seen by the RAD server at example.com
to the local UDP port 8000 on 127.0.0.1:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
radtunnel -s ssh:rad-service@example.com -o nmsg:127.1,8000 \\
	-w ip=0/1 -w ip=128.0/1 -a ip14-80
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width config
.It Ar certs
is the directory set with
.Fl S
that contains TLS certificate and key files.
.It Ar config
is the
.Xr ssh_config 5
configuration file used with
.Ar connect\ ssh:...
connections.
"Host" stanzas in the file can simplify connections to \*(SR servers.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If set, AXACONF specifies the AXA configuration directory instead of the
default,
.Pa ~/.axa
or
.Pa @CONFDIR@ .
